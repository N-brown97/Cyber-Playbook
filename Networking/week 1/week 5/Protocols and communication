TCP VS. UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Connection-oriented → requires a handshake.
Reliable → guarantees delivery, order, and error correction.
Slower → more overhead due to tracking and acknowledgments.
Used for: web browsing, email, file transfers.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
Connectionless → no handshake, just sends data.
Unreliable → no delivery guarantee, may lose or reorder packets.
Faster → minimal overhead, lightweight.
Used for: streaming, online gaming, voice/video calls.
