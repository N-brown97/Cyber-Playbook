You would use star topolgies when-
You need simple and cost-effective network setups (e.g., small offices, classrooms).
Easy troubleshooting and maintenance is a priority.
Centralized control is preferred (everything connects through a central switch/hub).
You're okay with central point of failure (if the hub/switch goes down, all connections fail).

VS 

Using Mesh Topolgies-
High reliability and redundancy are critical (no single point of failure).
The network must stay up even if one or more connections fail.
You’re connecting many devices in a large, distributed system.
Bandwidth usage and cost is less of a concern (because it’s expensive and complex to set up).

A few key differences between a swtich and router:
A switch connects devices within a network where a router connects to different networks.
A switch is a network bridge where a router is a network gateway.
A switch forwards data within the same network where a router routes data between networks.
A switch has basic security features as to where a router has more advanced features.
