## ‚öôÔ∏è Major Hardware Components

| **Component** | **Primary Purpose** | **Key Specs / Facts** |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Motherboard** | Central backbone that connects all components | ATX = 305√ó244 mm, microATX = 244√ó244 mm; contains chipset, sockets, RAM slots, expansion slots |
| **CPU (Processor)** | Performs all calculations and logic operations | Clock speed (GHz), cores/threads, cache (L1‚ÄìL3), supports virtualization (VT-x/AMD-V) |
| **RAM (Memory)** | Temporary working storage for active data | DDR4 & DDR5 (288-pin); dual-channel for higher bandwidth; volatile memory |
| **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** | Converts AC ‚Üí DC and provides system power | 20/24-pin ATX main, 4+4 CPU, 6+2 PCIe connectors; rated in watts |
| **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)** | Magnetic spinning storage | 5400 or 7200 RPM; SATA 6 Gb/s; slower but higher capacity |
| **SSD (Solid State Drive)** | Flash memory storage (no moving parts) | SATA 2.5" or NVMe (PCIe x4 M.2); much faster read/write speeds |
| **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** | Handles rendering and parallel computations | Dedicated PCIe x16 card or integrated on CPU; GDDR6 VRAM |
| **Cooling System** | Removes heat from CPU/GPU | Air (fan + heatsink) or liquid (radiator + pump); thermal paste required |
| **BIOS / UEFI Firmware** | Initializes hardware, controls boot sequence | Stores configuration on CMOS battery; access via F2/Del key at startup |
| **Peripherals** | Input/output interaction | Keyboard, mouse, printers, monitors, VR headsets, webcams |
| **Optical Drive** | Reads/writes CDs/DVDs (legacy) | SATA connection; largely replaced by USB or digital installs |
| **Expansion Cards** | Add functionality to motherboard | NICs, sound cards, capture cards; inserted into PCIe slots |
