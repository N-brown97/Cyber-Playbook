There are six different ram types for different functions depending on what you need.
Static RAM (SRAM)- Use: Found in cache memory (CPU cache, hard drive buffers).
Dynamic RAM (DRAM)- Use: Main system memory in computers.
SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM)- Improvement over DRAM â€“ Use: Syncs with the system clock for faster operation. (this was common back in the 90's)
DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM)- Use: Transfers data twice per clock cycle (on rising and falling edges).
GDDR (Graphics DDR RAM)- Use: Specialized DDR version for graphics cards (GPUs).
VRAM (Video RAM)- Use: Older term, used for dedicated video memory.

There are also multiple different storage types on a computer depending on the type/age of the computer, what you're going to be storing and where you're storing it at.
Hard Disk Drive (HDD)- How it works: Uses spinning magnetic platters to read/write data. 
Solid-State Drive (SSD)- How it works: Uses flash memory chips (no moving parts).
NVMe SSD (Non-Volatile Memory Express)- How it works: A newer type of SSD that connects directly via PCIe instead of SATA.
Optical Drives (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)- How it works: Uses lasers to read/write data on discs.
USB Flash Drives- How it works: Portable flash memory.
External Hard Drives / SSDs- How it works: HDDs or SSDs in portable enclosures.
Cloud Storage- How it works: Data stored on remote servers, accessed via the internet.
