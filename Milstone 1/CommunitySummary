Campaign Proposal: “Youth & Online Security Awareness”
1. Target Audience-
The campaign is designed for youth ages 13–18, who are among the most active smartphone and social media users. At this age, many are beginning to manage personal devices, 
interact online, and make digital choices that can impact both their safety and their families.

2. Rationale
Nearly all teens own or have access to a smartphone, which functions as a mini-computer in their pocket.
Social media (TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat) and online gaming platforms encourage constant sharing of personal details.
Attackers can exploit oversharing or weak security practices to gain access to accounts, devices, or even family networks.
Educating youth now helps protect them today and prepares them for responsible digital citizenship in adulthood.

3. Campaign Goal
To raise awareness among youth about online risks and teach practical, relatable steps they can take to protect their personal data, devices, and families.

4. Key Messages
Think Before You Share – Personal information is valuable and can be exploited.
Stronger Passwords, Safer Accounts – Use unique, complex passwords and enable MFA.
Spot the Red Flags – Recognize phishing, scams, and suspicious DMs.
Privacy is Power – Control who sees your posts and limit app permissions.
Protect Your Future – Digital habits now affect opportunities later (college, jobs).

5. Delivery Method
To connect with youth, the campaign will use platforms and formats they already engage with:
TikTok & Instagram Reels – Short, eye-catching videos that demonstrate online risks and safety tips.
Interactive Infographic/Poster – A shareable visual guide for classrooms, youth groups, or campus boards.
Live Demo/Workshop – A hands-on activity where students analyze “realistic” phishing messages or social media oversharing scenarios.

6. Deliverables
A short awareness video (TikTok-style)
A polished infographic/poster highlighting key safety tips
A slide deck + mini-workshop for youth groups or campus presentations
A reflection report documenting audience response and campaign impact (portfolio-ready)

7. Expected Impact
By the end of the campaign, participants will:
Be able to identify common online threats relevant to teens.
Adopt at least one new personal security habit (e.g., stronger passwords, reviewing privacy settings).
Feel more confident about their role in protecting themselves and their families online.
