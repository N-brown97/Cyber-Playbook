Hi, my name is Nash. I’m 28 years old and new to the IT field. While I don’t have a lot of direct experience yet, I’ve always had a strong interest in technology. Recently, I started exploring more of what’s possible with computers and the internet, and it’s only deepened my curiosity.

I recently completed a general Cybersecurity certification through Chegg, and I really enjoyed the material. That experience motivated me to pursue an associate degree as well as additional certifications at Hocking. My main area of interest is Penetration Testing, and I’m eager to build more knowledge and skills in this area, as I think it would be a challenging and exciting career path within IT.

After graduation—or even before—I hope to secure a full-time remote position. Ideally, I’d like a role where I can work independently without needing constant face-to-face interaction or frequent calls throughout the day. My goal is to have the freedom to follow my routine, log in, complete my work, and log off—while being able to do so from anywhere in the world.
