# Privacy Best Practices – Reflection & Peer Input

As part of this exercise, I reviewed the suggested privacy best practices in the module and scored each on two scales: **(1–5)** for strength of privacy and **(A–F)** for how likely I would be to follow it. I also asked three friends to score the same practices, then designed three additional best practices of my own.

## My Scores

| Privacy Best Practice              | Strength (1–5) | My Likelihood (A–F) | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------|
| Use strong, unique passwords       | 5              | A                    | I use a password manager consistently. |
| Enable two-factor authentication   | 5              | A                    | I rely on 2FA for all important accounts. |
| Update devices & software          | 4              | B                    | I sometimes delay updates. |
| Limit sharing on social media      | 3              | C                    | Easy to overshare without thinking. |
| Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi          | 4              | B                    | I use it sometimes, but not always. |

## Friend Feedback

- **Passwords & 2FA:** All rated strength as high (5), but some admitted poor follow-through (D/F for likelihood).  
- **Social Media:** Everyone agreed limiting sharing is important, but most gave themselves D/F grades for likelihood.  
- **VPNs:** Mixed—one friend rated it 5/A, others C/D.  

**Takeaway:** People know best practices, but **knowledge doesn’t always equal action**. Convenience often wins.

## My Additional Best Practices

1. **Monthly privacy audits** – Check account permissions and connected apps.  
2. **Separate accounts for different purposes** – Use one email for banking and another for casual logins.  
3. **Educate peers and family** – Share what you learn to strengthen collective awareness.

## What I Learned

- Strongest protections come from **layered practices** (passwords + 2FA + updates).  
- Human behavior is the weak link—people know what to do but don’t always act.  
- Building habits and reminders (like scheduled privacy checks) can turn best practices into **consistent action**.  

**Bottom line:** Protecting privacy takes both **tools** and **discipline**.
