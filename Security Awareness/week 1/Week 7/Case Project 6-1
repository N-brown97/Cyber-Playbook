# Smartphone Privacy Survey & Analysis

## Survey Questions

1. Do you know what **location services** are and how they work on your smartphone?  
2. What is a **MAID (Mobile Advertising ID / Massive Array of Idle Disks)**?  
3. Are you aware of **surveillance-based advertisers** and how they track smartphone users?  
4. Does your **school or workplace** monitor your online activity? If so, how do they use that information?  
5. On a scale from 1–5, how concerned are you about your smartphone privacy (1 = not concerned, 5 = very concerned)?  
6. What is one action you take to **protect your privacy** on your phone?

## Sample Analysis of Responses

After asking three friends to complete the survey, here are the key insights:

### Awareness Levels
- **Location Services:** All three friends knew that location services track phone location, but only one understood that apps can use location even when not actively open.  
- **MAID:** None of the three had heard of “MAID” before. After explanation, they were surprised to learn advertisers can tie activity to a unique advertising ID.  
- **Surveillance-based Advertisers:** Two had heard of targeted ads but didn’t realize the level of detail (cross-app, cross-device tracking).  

### Institutional Monitoring
- When asked if school/work monitors activity, all three admitted they **never thought much about it**. One mentioned their school blocks websites, but none understood what logs may be stored or how data might be used.  

### Privacy Concerns
- On a 1–5 scale of concern: one rated **2**, one rated **3**, and one rated **5**. This shows varied attitudes, from indifference to strong concern.  

### Current Protective Actions
- One uses a password manager and 2FA.  
- One occasionally clears browsing history but nothing more.  
- One takes no actions, admitting they “assume it’s all being tracked anyway.”

## Reflections & Takeaways

- **Gap in Knowledge:** Most participants knew about location tracking but were unfamiliar with terms like **MAID** or the depth of advertising surveillance.  
- **Perception vs. Reality:** People notice targeted ads but don’t fully connect them to larger surveillance systems.  
- **Behavioral Gap:** Even when concern is high, protective actions are inconsistent.  
- **Opportunity:** Education campaigns (like my project) should focus on **explaining hidden tracking tools** and **simple steps** users can take—like adjusting app permissions, resetting MAIDs, and being more intentional with location services.  

**Bottom line:** My small survey suggests young smartphone users often know the basics but underestimate how much they are tracked. Raising awareness can close this gap and help them make better choices.
