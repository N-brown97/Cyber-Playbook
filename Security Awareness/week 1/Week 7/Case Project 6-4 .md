# VPNs, Logging, and Trust

Not all VPNs protect privacy as they claim. History shows some providers have logged and exposed user activity:

- **PureVPN (2017):** Gave connection logs to the FBI, contradicting its “no logs” claims.  
- **Hotspot Shield (2017):** Faced an FTC complaint for undisclosed tracking.  
- **UFO VPN (2020):** Exposed millions of user logs in a misconfigured database.  
- **Hola VPN (2015):** Misused users’ bandwidth by reselling it through another service.  

These cases show why audits and technical design matter more than marketing.

## What Do Current Providers Say?

- **Mullvad:** States no logs are kept. Anonymous numbered accounts. Police raid in 2023 confirmed no customer data was available.  
- **Proton VPN:** Explicit no-logs policy. Passed four independent audits (latest in 2025). Open-source apps.  
- **ExpressVPN:** Privacy policy bans logging activity/connection data. Audited multiple times; its RAM-only **TrustedServer** system minimizes data storage.  

All three admit to keeping minimal account data (like payment info), but none retain browsing or traffic logs.

## How Can No-Logs Claims Be Verified?

- Independent third-party audits.  
- Court or law-enforcement tests (e.g., Mullvad raid).  
- Technical design like RAM-only servers.  
- Open-source clients and bug bounties.  

## Recommendation

**Best choice: Mullvad** — because of its minimalist data model and court-tested no-logs proof.  
**Strong alternatives:** Proton VPN (audit-backed, open source) and ExpressVPN (audited RAM-only servers).  

**Summary:** Choose a VPN that offers **verifiable no-logs policies** backed by audits or legal tests, not just marketing promises.
