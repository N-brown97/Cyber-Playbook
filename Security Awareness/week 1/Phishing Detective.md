## 1. Urgent: Account Access Restricted

-   **Generic greeting**: "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name.\
-   **Urgency/threat**: "Failure to act within 24 hours" --- pressure
    tactic.\
-   **Suspicious link**: "Verify My Account Now" (no real domain shown,
    likely spoofed).\
-   **No company details**: Just "Security Team," no phone, no
    verifiable info.

## 2. Congratulations! You are the Winner

-   **Unexpected prize**: You didn't enter a contest.\
-   **Suspicious attachment**: Asking you to download and fill out a
    file --- classic malware/data theft trick.\
-   **Urgency**: "Offer expires today!"\
-   **Impersonation**: "Amazon Rewards Department" --- Amazon doesn't
    send rewards this way.

## 3. Payroll Correction Needed

-   **Scare tactic**: "Incorrect paycheck" creates panic.\
-   **Data theft**: Requesting bank details directly.\
-   **Suspicious link**: URL is `http://hr-update-payroll.example` ---
    not a legitimate company HR portal.\

    scrutiny.

## 4. Immediate Assistance Required

-   **Impersonation of authority**: Pretends to be CEO.\
-   **Urgency**: "Must be completed before end of day."\
-   **Unusual request**: Gift cards are a huge red flag (scammers love
    them because they're untraceable).\
-   **No normal communication method**: Claims they can't be reached by
    phone.

## 5. Critical Software Patch -- Action Required

-   **Suspicious download**: Asking to install unknown software ---
    likely malware.\
