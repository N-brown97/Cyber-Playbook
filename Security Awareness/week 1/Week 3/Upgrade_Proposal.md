For these upgrades we are going to be referencing a Dell XPS 8960 tower. Here are some base specs.
CPU: Intel Core i5-13400 (13th Gen, 10 cores / 16 threads)
RAM: 8 GB DDR5 (1Ã—8 GB, expandable up to 64 GB across 4 DIMM slots)
Storage: 512 GB NVMe SSD (M.2 PCIe Gen 4)
Graphics: Intel UHD 730 integrated graphics (some configs include NVIDIA RTX 3050 or higher)
Motherboard: Custom Dell ATX (supports 13th/14th Gen Intel CPUs, DDR5 RAM)
Power Supply: 460W (base) or optional 750W PSU in higher configs
Upgrades-
CPU: Intel Core i7-14700- 20 cores (8 Performance + 12 Efficient), 28 threads
socket type is LGA1700 which is compatiable with the stock motherboard
This is going to be much more efficient than the I5 with multitasking and a good balance between performance and cost.
You will need to ensure you update your BIOS to add 14th gen CPU support as well as possibley thinking about upgrading the fans or cools system as thid upgraded CPU will run hotter.
Ram:Crucial RAM DDR5-5600 
Dual 16GB Moduels so 32GB total.
Speed:5600 MHz
Max capacity per the sytem would be 64GB
This RAM is a plug an plug upgrade so no changes should need to be made to the UEFI/BIOS system.
Storage: I dont know for the average person if it would really be nesscary to upgrade as the OEM capacity is 512GB, if you were need more this is the option i would suggest.
Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB NVMe SSD
A lot more storage and a lot faster bootup and load times
After making the upgrades i would go into my UEFI and make sure to update/change a few things as fallows.
First id make sure id update to the latest BIOS/UEFI to ensure its compatilble with the upgrades i made
Second Id make sure that the computer is reading the correct upgrades, make sure it reads the new CPU/RAM/SSD ect.
Third i would go in an enable AHCI to improve the SSD performance.
Fourth, Change the boot order to make the new NVMe SSD the first boot device and disable the old one.
Fifth Make sure secure boot is enabled and if not go in an enable it.
