Urgent: Account Access Restricted
Generic greeting: “Dear Customer” instead of your actual name. Urgency/threat: “Failure to act within 24 hours” — pressure tactic. Suspicious link: “Verify My Account Now” (no real domain shown, likely spoofed). No company details: Just “Security Team,” no phone, no verifiable info.
Congratulations! You are the Winner
Unexpected prize: You didn’t enter a contest. Suspicious attachment: Asking you to download and fill out a file — classic malware/data theft trick. Urgency: “Offer expires today!” Impersonation: “Amazon Rewards Department” — Amazon doesn’t send rewards this way.
Payroll Correction Needed
Scare tactic: “Incorrect paycheck” creates panic. Data theft: Requesting bank details directly. Suspicious link: URL is http://hr-update-payroll.example/ — not a legitimate company HR portal. Unusual instructions: “Do not reply” — prevents questions and scrutiny.
Immediate Assistance Required
Impersonation of authority: Pretends to be CEO. Urgency: “Must be completed before end of day.” Unusual request: Gift cards are a huge red flag (scammers love them because they’re untraceable). No normal communication method: Claims they can’t be reached by phone.
Critical Software Patch – Action Required
Fear tactic: “Dangerous virus” and “permanent data loss.” Suspicious download: Asking to install unknown software — likely malware. Generic sender: “Dear User” with no company identity. Pressure: Framing compliance as mandatory.  Common Red Flags Across All: Generic greetings. Urgency/threats. Suspicious links or attachments. Requests for sensitive info or money. Impersonation of authority or companies.
